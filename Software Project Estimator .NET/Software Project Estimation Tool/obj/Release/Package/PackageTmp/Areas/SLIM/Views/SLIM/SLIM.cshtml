        SLIM is an automated costing system based on the Rayleigh-Putnam Model. SLIM applies the Putnam software model, linear programming, statistical simulation, and program evaluation and review technique (PERT) techniques to derive software project estimates. SLIM works reasonably well for very large systems, but seriously overestimates the effort for medium and small systems. Some versions of SLIM use a so-called skill factor β, which is a scaling term and is a function of project size.

        Software Lifecycle Management Model contains three phases:
